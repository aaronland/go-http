# go-http

Opinionated package of wrapper, helper and utility functions for working with HTTP-related services.

## Documentation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/aaronland/go-http.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aaronland/go-http/v3)

Documentation remains incomplete despite this being a "v3" release. Documentation, such as it is, can be found in the individual sub-packages.

## Motivation

There are many wrapper libraries for working with HTTP-related services. This one is mine. It is NOT comprehensive and instead reflects those services which occupy my time or have done so in the past. This is also NOT a "framework". It is a collection of packages and methods designed with "composability" in mind.

It is the merging of a number of other `aaronland/go-http-SERVICE` packages. The `v3` versioning is simply a reflection of version "3" being greater than the most recent `aaronland/go-http-SERVICE` package.
